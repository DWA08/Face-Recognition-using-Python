README for Student Facial Data Capture Script
Overview

This script captures facial images of students using a webcam, saves the images with the student's name, and stores the data in a file. It allows you to capture a specified number of student images and store their details for future use.

Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- opencv-python

You can install the necessary package using pip:


pip install opencv-python


 How to Run

1. Clone or Download the Script

   Download the script to your local machine and save it as `student_face_capture.py`.

2. Set Up the Environment

   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. If not, download and install it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/).

3. Install Required Libraries

   Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the OpenCV library:

   
   pip install opencv-python
   

4. Connect Your Webcam

   Ensure your webcam is connected and functioning properly. The script will use the default webcam for capturing images.

5. Run the Script

   Navigate to the directory where you saved the script and run it using the following command:

   
   python student_face_capture.py
   

6. Capture Student Data

   - The script will initialize the webcam and display the video feed.
   - Press the `c` key to capture an image.
   - You will be prompted to enter the student's name. Type the name and press Enter.
   - The captured image will be saved in the `student_data` directory with the student's name.
   - Repeat the process until the specified number of student images is captured.

7. Completion

   - Once the specified number of students is captured, the script will stop capturing images.
   - The student data, including the image paths, will be saved to a file named `students_details.txt`.

File Structure

- `student_face_capture.py`: The main script file.
- `student_data/`: A directory to store the captured student images.
- `students_details.txt`: A file to store the student names and image paths.

Notes

- You can change the number of students to capture by modifying the `num_students_to_capture` variable in the script.
- Ensure the `student_data` directory is created before running the script.
- Make sure to allow webcam access if prompted by your system.

Example Output


Enter student's name: John Doe
Data capture completed.

Troubleshooting

- If the webcam feed does not appear, ensure that your webcam is properly connected and recognized by your system.
- If you encounter issues with OpenCV installation, try installing the library in a virtual environment.

This script provides a simple way to capture and store student facial data using Python and OpenCV. Feel free to modify and extend it according to your needs.
